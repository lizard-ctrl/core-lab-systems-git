    <h3>Repository</h3>
    <p>
      The code base. This is where all project files and their revision history (like an undo history) are stored. You usually have a local repository on your computer and remote repository hosted on the internet that you are trying to keep in sync.
    </p>

    <h3>Branch</h3>
    <p>
      A version of a repository. You can have multiple branches of the same code base. A branch named `master`  is created by default for a new repository.
    </p>

    <h3>Commit</h3>
    <p>
      A snapshot of a particular time in a branch's history.
    </p>

    <h3>
      <code>git branch</code>
    </h3>
    <p>
      List the branches in the current repository.
